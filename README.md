# TODO App

A minimalist TODO management app focused on a beautiful, modern interface. The UI now features a dark palette with luxurious gold accents and subtle purple and navy tones.

## Features

- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Remaining task counter

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (Flask only):
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

Tasks are stored in memory, so they reset on each restart.
